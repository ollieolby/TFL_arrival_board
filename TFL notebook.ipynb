    "Let me start by outlining a problem I had. I live in a very unique part of London. I live equidistant from 2 district line stations. This is not unique, the uniqueness comes from both stations being on separate branches of the district line which join when going eastbound. This means that every time I leave the house to go eastbound, I need to check which station to go to to arrive faster. This means walking down my road with my phone out frantically searching on google maps to find the faster route (just finding the directions isnt efficient as it normally sets your departure time a few minutes after your actual departure time). I appreciate this is a small problem, but I am fortunate enough to be able to solve it and have some fun, so I gave it a go.\n",
